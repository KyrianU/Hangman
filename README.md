# Hangman

# The Aim of the project

 Hangman is a python terminal game, that runs on the code institute mock terminal called Heroku. The game is aimed at users who like to play a game of hangman. The game is split into 3 caterogies( Cars, Animals and Countries) and the user will have to choose which category they want to try before the game generates a random word from that category. The game will generate a random word for which the player will have 6 attempts per word before the game is declared over

# User goals
